		<h2>About the Author</h2>
		<p>Jason W. Park received his BA in 1997 with honors in philosophy from Harvard University. He was born a true “Jayhawk” in Lawrence, Kansas, the campus town for the University of Kansas, where his father began his professional career as a professor. At the age of 4, Dr. Park followed his family to Pittsburgh, where he spent his formative years from nursery school to high school. He took a liking to the piano, and with his parents’ encouragement, assiduously practiced on the family Steinway and underwent rigorous training, achieving excellent results. As a teenager he played in two solo piano recitals at New York’s Carnegie Hall, performing Heitor Villa-Lobos’s “La Polichinelle” one year and Domenico Zipoli’s “Gigue” the next. It was about this time that he began his budding romance with the sport of lacrosse. He had always been athletic, and had played junior high school football successfully, but he needed a contact sport that emphasized finesse more than force. Once his parents bought Dr. Park his first lacrosse stick and protective gear, he knew he had arrived. As a high school junior and senior, he had lettered as a varsity player in lacrosse.
</p><p>
Dr. Park left the City of Champions to matriculate in Harvard University. Once on campus, he cultivated his love for ancient Chinese (Confucius and Hsün Tzu) and modern German (Kant and Nietzsche) moral philosophy. During his four-year sojourn in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dr. Park stretched his musical tastes by broadcasting a weekly jazz music program from WHRB-95.3 FM Harvard Radio, throughout metropolitan Boston featuring such greats as the bandleader Quincy Jones, the Pittsburgh saxophonist Stanley Turrentine and the multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef.  He also became a starting player for Harvard Freshman Lacrosse, contributing from the midfielder position primarily, and was a member of the Harvard Boxing Club, practicing jabs, hooks and uppercuts. Dr. Park’s senior honors thesis compared and contrasted Kant’s and Nietzsche’s ethical ideals, specifically Kant’s good will and Nietzsche’s übermensch. Dr. Stanley Cavell, Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, sat on Dr. Park’s honors committee. For his efforts, Dr. Park was granted “with honors” status by Harvard’s Department of Philosophy.
</p><p>
After college, Dr. Park relocated to Los Angeles and thought deeply about the meaning of life while bouncing around from odd job to odd job, before returning to academia in Pittsburgh as a PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of Business. After three years on coursework and three years on the dissertation, Dr. Park earned the distinction of PhD in strategic management. His dissertation was two-essay in format—quantitative/deductive/large sample and qualitative/inductive/small sample—and focused on a Complex Adaptive Systems model of Mergers and Acquisitions waves. This high-risk, unconventional dissertation topic secured him a highly lauded employment as an assistant professor in Hong Kong at the City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business in the Department of Management, before Dr. Park returned after two years to the United States. 
</p><p>
“Heaven + Hell = Harvard” is Dr. Park’s first book. In that memoir, he discusses with candid fervor his edgy, ill-fated college-day romance with illicit drugs. He considers it a personal triumph that from the age of 20, when he was “everything but heroin,” now he is “nothing but caffeine” 20 years later, at age 40.
</p><p>
Dr. Park likens the City of Angels to his stomping grounds, and views himself professionally as an author.		</p>
