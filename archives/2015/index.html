		<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Jason W. Park received his BA in 1997 with honors in philosophy from Harvard University. He was born a true Jayhawk in Lawrence, Kansas, the campus town for the University of Kansas, where his father was a professor. At the age of 4, Dr. Park followed his family to Pittsburgh, where he spent his formative years from nursery school to high school. At an early age, he displayed talent on the piano, and with his parents’ encouragement, assiduously practiced on the family Steinway to undergo rigorous training, achieving excellent results. He performed in two solo piano recitals at New York’s Carnegie Hall, performing Heitor Villa-Lobos’s “Le Polichinelle” one year and Domenico Zipoli’s “Gigue” the next. Around the same time,  he began his romance with the sport of lacrosse. He had always been athletic, and had played junior high school football successfully, but he needed a contact sport that emphasized finesse more than force. Once his parents bought Dr. Park his first lacrosse stick, he knew he had arrived. As a high school junior and senior, he lettered as a varsity player in America’s First Sport. 
</p><p>
Dr. Park left the City of Champions to matriculate in Harvard University. Once on campus, he was introduced to his intellectual love: ancient Chinese (Confucius and Hsün Tzu) and modern German (Kant and Nietzsche) moral philosophy. Meanwhile, Dr. Park stretched his musical tastes by broadcasting a weekly jazz music program from WHRB-95.3 FM Harvard Radio, throughout metropolitan Boston featuring such greats as the vocalist Sarah Vaughan, bandleader Quincy Jones, saxophonist Stanley Turrentine and the multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef. He also was a starting player for Harvard Lacrosse, contributing from the midfielder position primarily, and was a member of the Harvard Boxing Club, practicing jabs, hooks and uppercuts. Dr. Park’s senior honors thesis compared and contrasted Kant’s and Nietzsche’s ethical ideals, specifically Kant’s good will and Nietzsche’s übermensch, with regard to achieving philosophical freedom. Dr. Stanley Cavell, Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, sat on Dr. Park’s honors committee. For his intellectual toil, Dr. Park was bestowed “with honors” status by Harvard’s Department of Philosophy. 
</p><p>
After college, Dr. Park relocated to Los Angeles and thought deeply about the meaning of life while bouncing around from odd job to odd job, before returning to academia in Pittsburgh as a PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of Business. After three years of coursework, he passed the comprehensive exams with distinction, and after three additional years of dissertation research, Dr. Park earned the distinction of PhD in strategic management. His dissertation was two-essay in format--quantitative/deductive/large-sample and qualitative/inductive/small-sample--and focused on a Complex Adaptive Systems model of Mergers and Acquisitions waves. This high-risk, unconventional dissertation topic secured him highly coveted employment as an assistant professor in Hong Kong at the City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business in the Department of Management, before Dr. Park returned to the United States to begin his writing career. 
</p><p>
“Heaven + Hell = Harvard” is Dr. Park’s first book. In this memoir, he discusses with candid fervor his edgy, ill-fated college-day tryst with illicit drugs. He considers it a personal triumph that from age 20, when he was “everything but heroin,” now he is “nothing but caffeine” 20 years later, at age 40. 
</p><p>
Dr. Park likens the City of Angels to his stomping grounds, and is comfortable in his newfound role as author.
