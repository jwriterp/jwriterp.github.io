<span class="first-char">G</span>reen lasers shot through the undercover darkness of a machine-made fog blanketing the warehouse space, the spot rented for the night’s rave in an industrial neighborhood in Boston. The house/techno music thudded in my overwhelmed ears at a constant 140 Beats Per Minute, on and on, repeatedly, never-ending, unstoppable, over and over again. On the dancefloor, I picked up shadowy glimpses of bodies gyrating to the beat, but I was in no mood for dancing. It was all I could do to just walk around and take drags off a lit cigarette to contain my anxiety.

As I paced, I inspected my wristwatch, the time barely visible in the light. In the last half-hour no spiritual awakening had overcome me. I had washed down a quarter of the XTC pill 30 minutes ago with a swig of water, then another one-fourth 15 minutes after that with more agua, and yet I wandered around the tame outskirts of the party, feeling like the only uninitiated virgin in the entire red-light district of Amsterdam. I flicked my still-lit butt off into outer space, followed its glow to the floor, and ground it out under my foot before lighting up another. I was running out of drugs, out of time, out of water, out of cigarettes and out of patience...

		<h2>About the Book</h2>
		<p>
People talk a lot about getting into Harvard, but not much about getting out. In this memoir, part hilariousreminiscence, part cautionary tale, the author details his experiences as one of Harvard’s Class of 1997. Whether revealing the secret classroom discussions of moral philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche, or detailing the clandestine off-campus goings-on at rave parties and night clubs, the author paints an ironic and highly critical portrait of Harvard in the mid-1990s. Within a number of his intimate descriptions of classmates and fellow partyers, as well as parents and teachers, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of their actions. With an understanding of Harvard gained by reading this memoir, the reader can detect subtle satire at work. In doing so, "Heaven + Hell = Harvard" pulls no punches, hits hard, shoots straight and tells it "like it is."
